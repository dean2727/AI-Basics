Blocksworld Problem Generator
-----------------------------

This program will generate a random initial configuration as a start
state, with S stacks and B blocks, as specified.  Then it will apply 
a sequence of N random moves to produce a goal state.

> python blockgen.py <S:int> <B:int> <N:int>

Input args: 3 integers: 
  S: number of stacks
  B: number of blocks
  N: number of scrambling steps or moves 

Output format:

line 1: 3 integers: number of stacks S, number of blocks B, # of moves (-1 if unknown)
line 2: separator ">>>>>>>>>>"
next S lines: list of blocks in each stack for the start state
separator ">>>>>>>>>>"
next S lines: list of blocks in each stack for the goal state
separator ">>>>>>>>>>"

example:

> python blockgen.py 3 5 2
3 5 2
>>>>>>>>>>
A               //
CB              // start state
ED              //
>>>>>>>>>>
AB           //
             // goal state
EDC          // 
>>>>>>>>>>


In this case, there are 3 stacks and 5 blocks.  After the separator,
the next 3 lines show the stacks for the start state written
horizontally, which correponds to this picture:

  B D
A C E
------

After another separator, the next 3 lines show the goal state
correponding to this configuration (with all the blocks stacked in
order on the first stack, and the second and third stacks empty):

     C
B    D
A    E
------
