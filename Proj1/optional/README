additional Blockworld problems on which to test:

 * testcase4.bwp - solution depth=7
 * blocks1.bwp - solution depth=10 (example from the handout)
   (blocks1.out - this is the solution path, though you might not be able to solve it with BFS)
 *  bwchp06.bwp - solution depth=21 (won't be able to do this with BFS - should fail after MAX iterations)
